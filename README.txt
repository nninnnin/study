This is my(justin, Lee Dong gyu from Korea) web programming study folder. These stuffs are based on various sources like books, lectures(online and offline both), and peer code study with my web-study club '멋쟁이 사자처럼(LikeLion)'.


Mostly the original sources are clarified on the end of the each documents. source codes are classified with the folder names. Thank you for watching my stuff and hope you be helpful with this!
